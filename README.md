# Accordion-Menu-In-Tkinter
Accordion menu is just a list of options stacked on top of each other, and when we click on one option ,its content appears on the bottom of it, and when other options are clicked then all the remaining contents that were opened before will close, and one which was clicked will be opened.

This is what I have tried to implement in tkinter.
